Previously we were pushing code from local to github, once it got deployed to heroku,
then we changed the .git to .git-be. ( as .git was meant previously for github ).
After deploying on heroku a new .git (used for heroku now) folder is created in project location.

Suppose again we need to push code to github from local then we need to change .git to .git-be and .git-be to .git
We could have connected github directly to heroku but it requires pipeline ( to use pipeline in heroku, payment needs to be done )
So we are using postgres DB free attachement on heroku and api is being deployed on heroku using java technology.
Suppose we made any changes in the code in local then we need to add, commit and push to heroku using point#.

#How to commit or push code from local when connected or api deployed in heroku platform :

heroku login
username : rahulpandeyb1995@gmail.com
password : R@hulb1995
git status
git add .
git commit -m ""
git status
git push heroku master

Again suppose we want to deploy to github change
